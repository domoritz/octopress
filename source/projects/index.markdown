# CKAN

[CKAN](http://www.ckan.org) is a powerful data management system that makes data accessible – by providing tools to streamline publishing, sharing, finding and using data. CKAN is aimed at data publishers (national and regional governments, companies and organizations) wanting to make their data open and available.

Development happens on [GitHub](https://github.com/okfn/ckan).
