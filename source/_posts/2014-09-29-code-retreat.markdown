This summer, I was at Google in NYC for an awesome internship. This post is about a [Code Retreat](http://coderetreat.org/) that somebody at Google organized which I quite enjoyed. The idea is simple: Pair up a bunch of programmers and give them a simple programming task that they can solve together in any language but with a time constraint. Repeat this for a whole day for maximum fun. Each iteration may add [additional constraints](http://coderetreat.org/facilitating/activity-catalog) on how the team should work together or what they are allowed to use. It's a great opportunity to learn from each other when trying to bring your program to perfection.

We used [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) throughout the day and I've grown to like it a lot. I just wanted to share my simple [implementation in Python](https://github.com/domoritz/gameoflife-python) and my [first program in Go](https://github.com/domoritz/gameoflife-go).
