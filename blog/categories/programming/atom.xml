    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This summer, I was at Google in NYC for an awesome internship. However, in this post I want to talk about a <a href="http://coderetreat.org/">Code Retreat</a> that somebody at Google organized. The idea is simple: Pair up a bunch of programmers and give them a simple programming task that they can solve as a pair in any language but with a time constraint. Repeat this for a whole day for maximum fun. Each iteration may add <a href="http://coderetreat.org/facilitating/activity-catalog">additional constraints</a> on how the team should work together or what programming constructs they are allowed to use. It’s a great opportunity to learn from each other and from the experience of solving the same problem over and over again and bringing your program to perfection.</p>

<p>We used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a> throughout the day and I’ve grown to like it a lot. I just wanted to share my simple <a href="https://github.com/domoritz/gameoflife-python">implementation in Python</a> and my <a href="https://github.com/domoritz/gameoflife-go">first program in Go</a>.</p>
